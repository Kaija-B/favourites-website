    <h2 class="sharks">Sharks</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      I've always held a profound interest for the ocean and all things and
      beings in it, but sharks have a special place in my heart. Arguably one of
      the most misunderstood predators on the planet, sharks are an incredible
      hunter species with around 530 subspecies!

    <hr />
    <p>
      I believe video games are a great way to engage with your imagination and
      explore different realms of possibilities. Even though I'm a fairly casual
      video game enjoyer, there are a few I love and play quite often:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Little Nightmares (+DLC)</li>
      <li>Little Nightmares 2</li>
      <li>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</li>
      <li>Minecraft</li>
      <li>Animal Crossing</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="history">History and mythology</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Learning about the world's history is very important for our society to be
      able to evolve. Luckily for me, I really enjoy learning about history,
      mythology, and various other aspects of different cultures around the
      world. Some specfici historical interests of mine include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Anicent Greece</li>
      <li>Norse culture/vikings</li>
      <li>Renaissance/Japanese renaissance</li>
      <li>Colonisation of Africa</li>
      <li>Plagues, famines, and uprisings</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="music">Music</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Music has been a passion of mine for as long as I can remember. I play
      several instruments and love listening to music as well as making it. Some
      of my favourite bands are Radiohead, System of a Down, The Cure, The
      Arctic Monkeys, and Deftones.
